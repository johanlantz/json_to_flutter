# json_to_flutter

An experimental library that takes a json file and dynamically turns it into a Flutter app.

The json can be fetched locally or for instance from a webserver to get live updates.

Support for custom native widgets and device navigation is also implemented.

Note that this is an experiment and not in any way meant for production. There is also a corresponding editor project here: https://github.com/johanlantz/json_to_flutter_editor
